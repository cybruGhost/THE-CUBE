## 🎥 What We Do

We **do not host** content.  
We **do not store** personal data.  
We **do not** break rules.

> We’re a **gateway**, not the destination.

At TheCube, users choose their own APIs, browse curated shows, and stream instantly — all inside a sleek, intuitive UI inspired by platforms you already love.

## 🔐 Account Creation & Security

- No real passwords or emails needed  
- Use simple credentials like `user@email.com / 20202020`  
- We only track basic metrics (traffic, views) via Google Analytics

> No watch history. No personal logs. Just pure streaming.

## 🔮 What’s Next?
