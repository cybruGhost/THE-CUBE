## 🎥 What We Do
All content accessible through our service is hosted by third-party websites. Users access content through these external platforms, which are solely responsible for the content they host.

We **do not host** content at all.  
We **do not store** personal data and we don't share it.

At TheCube, users choose their own APIs, browse curated shows, and stream instantly — all inside a sleek, intuitive UI inspired by platforms you already love.

## 🔐 Security
**Note:** THECUB4.VERCEL.APP doesn't require an account. You may sign in if you want to sync your data.

We only store watch history if signed in so that we sync to ur other devices. but collect no personal logs. Just pure streaming. if not signed in ..all data is stored on your device localstorage

---

## 🔮 What's Next?
We're evolving into a **zero-signup** platform for viewing.  
The future includes AI personalization and offline access.

## ⚖️ Legal Notice
- We index public content like any search engine
- We embed media using standard iframe techniques

All content resides with **third-party servers**.
